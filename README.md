Do you have severely mixed feelings about Facebook?

Sometimes I open Facebook in a new tab, scroll through a few pages, close the tab, and do the same thing about thirty seconds later. I hate this.

"PACEBOOK" is a dumb Chrome extension to help you deal with social media malaise. Simply install it, and it will unsubtly indicate how many times you've visited Facebook. The more of your life you waste, the less subtle it gets!

To install: 

Download the contents of this repo, open the Extensions view in Chrome, enable Developer mode, and click "Load unpacked extension...". Point the file dialog to wherever you downloaded the repo. Enjoy?
